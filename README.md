#Software Dependencies 
#-----------------------
# Pyplot
# sys 
# numpy 


#How to use this program 
# ----------------------------
# the format is as follows 
# $ python plot.py [your filename here] [Material Name ] [ Color of the line in the graph] 
# your file must be formatted with the data staring on the 33rd line 
# the stress data must be in the 3rd column 
# The Strain data must be inthe 8th column 
# only one sample per file 
# if your files contain more than one test then you must copy and split the file 
# you can do this by 
# cp your directory/file to split     directory to copy to/file name of copy 






# What I've Learned 
# -----------------------------
# I learned how to add files to git 
# I learned how to create my own files like the different tests and this README file 
# I had trouble with getting the right columns for the data and also trouble with getting the plot to display # my computer was taking very long to generate the plots ( i wonder if theres a faster way or if there
# were just too many entries


#Notes
#-----------------------------
# I saved the graphs in a directory called graphs under p1-start 
# i dont know how to access them ......
